# ncl-colour-table-converter
This repo hosts 3 different scripts which could be used to convert the premade colour table from NCL to the format usable in 
1. Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) - use "ncl2grads.sh"
2. Matlab - use "ncl2grads.m", it was named "ncl2grads.m" because the script was originally written for those who use Matlab to convert the ncl colour tables for use in GrADS. 
3. Quantum GIS (QGIS) - use "ncl2qgis.sh"

These scripts were written to help students or anyone who want to create their maps using premade colour tables from NCL but not wanting to go through the hassles in recreating them in their software of choice.
NCL colour tables can be access via: https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Graphics/color_table_gallery.shtml

The ".sh" scripts were written on Xubuntu 16, tested on MobaXterm on Windows 10, and only "ncl2grads.sh" was tested on Mac (I do not have a Mac machine, thus I can't further test my "ncl2qgis.sh" code on Mac).

Instructions on how to use the scripts were written in the top lines of each of the scripts.

Hope these scripts will be helpful to you.
